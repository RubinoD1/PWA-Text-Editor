# PWA: Text Editor 

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/RubinoD1/PWA-Text-Editor

## Introduction 

User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Pseudocode

1) When I open the application:
- I see the client-server folder structure

2) When I run 'npm start' from the root directory:
- THEN I find that my application should start up the back end and serve the client

3) WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
- THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

4) WHEN I run my webpack plugins
- THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

5) WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
- THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

6) WHEN I open the text editor
- THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

7) WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
- THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

8) WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
- THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB database

9) WHEN I click on the Install button
- THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop

10) WHEN I load my web application
- THEN I should have a registered service worker using Workbox

11) WHEN I register a service worker
- THEN I should have my static assets precached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

12) WHEN I deploy to Heroku
- THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
